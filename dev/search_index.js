Only the product-level data are required, but are by themselves insufficient.  For instance, for BLP95 one needs information on products, market sizes, and demographics; for the Grumps estimator one needs all four types of data; for a multinomial logit both consumer and product information are needed.  Not all data are needed for all markets.  For instance, it is ok for some estimators for there to be consumer-level data in some markets but not others.\n\nThe T argument is mostly there to allow for future expansion, so the description below applies to the case in which T = DefaultSourceTypes.\n\nBy default, the entries can be nothing, a string, a DataFrame, or a SourceFileType.  If an entry is nothing, it means that no such data is to be used.  If an entry is a string then it is converted to a SourceFileCSV entry with comma delimiter where the string name is the file name.  To use other source file types, create a SourceFileType first.  A DataFrame can be passed, also.  In all cases other than nothing, data will eventually be (converted to) a DataFrame and parsed from that.\n\nThe consumers variable specifies where consumer-level data can be found, the products variable is for the product-level data, marketsizes is for market sizes, and draws is for demographic draws; user has not been implemented yet.\n\nUse the Variables method to specify the way the data sources are formatted and the specification to estimate.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"objects/#Grumps.Variables-Tuple{}","page":"User Interface","title":"Grumps.Variables","text":"function Variables( ; \n  market              :: Symbol = :market,\n  choice              :: Symbol = :choice,\n  interactions        :: Mat{Symbol} = [],\n  randomcoefficients  :: Vec{Symbol} = [],\n  outsidegood         :: String = \"outsidegood\",\n  share               :: Symbol = :share,\n  marketsize          :: Symbol = :N,\n  regressors          :: Vec{Symbol} = [],\n  instruments         :: Vec{Symbol} = [],\n  dummies             :: Vec{Symbol} = [],\n  nuisancedummy       :: Symbol = :none,\n  microinstruments    :: Mat{Symbol} = [],\n  user                :: Mat{Symbol} = []\n    )\n\nThis method creates an object of type GrumpsVariables.  It contains references to the variables that Grumps uses to create variables from the data sources specified by the call to the Sources function. \n\nFor instance, market is the column heading in the source spreadsheets for the market indicator.  This get's passed as a symbol, so the default (:market) says that the column heading is market, which is both case and spaces sensititve.  The same column heading  is used across all sources.
