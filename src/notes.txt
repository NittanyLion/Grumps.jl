read the manual at https://nittanylion.github.io/Grumps.jl completely
read the paper at http://joris.pinkse.org/paper/grumps/
this is a preliminary version: bugs are to be expected, sanity checking and documentation are incomplete
still need to put in designed quadrature, so go easy on the random coefficients for now
does not do CUDA
uses multithreading, but no distributed computing
because of the way the random numbers for MC integration are drawn / multithreading, successive optimizations with the same data may not produce the exact same results
the gmm version should not be used: stick with grumps (or the cheap version thereof), mle, and sc: gmm is inferior to begin with and the gmm code is not ready for prime time
if you see unexpected behavior, please send me code and data so that I can replicate
all of the user-level commands are documented; e.g. use ?Save
please check the memory conservation documentation if memory becomes an issue
please direct all questions/suggestions/comments to Joris Pinkse at joris@psu.edu
