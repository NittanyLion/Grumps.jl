2 need to increase exports 
 1 these estimator definitions should be moved to their respective folders 
 4 must create a constructor for PMLFGH 
 3 still have to define the GrumpsSolution type 
 1 remember: only stick stuff in space structs that gets reused 
 4 must reset lastδ every time a new θ is computed 
 1 balancing scheme is different from before in that I now subtract out the mean; need to think about whether that's a good idea 
 2 make CreateK more efficient 
 2 there is duplication in CreateK versus the function below 
 3 the functions in this file should be checked carefully, especially CreateK 
 2 get rid of estimator version BS 
 4 make sure dataframes are sorted in the right order 
 2 data processing takes longer than it probably should 
 3 currently only saving θ coefficients 
 2 still need to compute standard errors 
 4 still need to do penalized estimator 
 2 SetHighWaterMark! not written yet 
 2 SetStatus! not written yet 
 2 save log and results to file 
 2 not sure if last call to pick up δ is needed 
 1 move sizes elsewhere 
 1 document micllf 
 2 parallelize MicroObjectiveθ! 
 2 parallelize MacroObjectiveθ! 
 2 figure out when to recompute 
 4 for all estimators, note that frugal is not compatible with for threads; need spawns 
 1 replace 𝓏𝓈 with zeros 
 2 REMOVE DUPLICATION WITH PREVIOUS FUNCTION 
 4 must check ntr_best! for bugs 
 4 must rewrite ntr_result! 
 4 change return value in pml_optimize to be consistent with the rest of Grumps 
 2 figure out when to recompute 
 4 call delta objective function outside across markets 
 1 document this file 
 3 too much garbage collection for gmm
